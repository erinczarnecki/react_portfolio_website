## Overview
A single-page-application built to showcase skills, past experience, and provide contact options. Use GitHub and Netlify to store/host website for low-cost solution.  
***

### Objectives

Users should be able to:

- Navigate easily on all screen sizes with visible and/or intuitive linking
- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
  - Create collapsible navigation to save space on smaller screen
  - Hide fixed side (social) links when viewing on smaller screen
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Fill out and send email through the embedded contact form

## My process

### Built With

- React JS
- Tailwind CSS
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
  
***

### What I Learned

- I used this project to explore TailwindCSS and imporve my React JS knowledge. I enjoyed being able to use the styling inside the JSX components, but I think there is room for improvement (especially in regards to DRY coding).  
- TailwindCSS uses a mobile first breakpoint system, and I struggled to create a medium/tablet screen layout that made use of the larger screen without compromising the component visibility.  
- If I were to start this project over...  
  -  I would try to wireframe 3 distinct layouts from the beginning rather than try to merge aspects of the small/large on-the-spot. 
  - The application feels a bit overloaded with information, so I think I would start with a MPA module from the beginning and build out components on their own pages

### **Continued Development**

- In the future, I would like to reformat this from a SPA to Multi-Page-Application where I can add greater detail to the projects and contact options. 
- Apart from this project, I would like to take the skills I've learned to recreate some static sites/pages with React
- Next I would like to continue improving my React skills by learning [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
